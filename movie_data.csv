Batman & Robin,3.7,"Action,Sci-Fi",A Russo brothers directed Batman &amp; Robin movie...
Batman & Robin,3.7,"Action,Sci-Fi",The hate for the russos is fr crazy. They are literally 4/4 when it comes to comic books. And it's not like they are making a Batman and Robin movie out of scratch either. They will have some input from James Gunn also.
Batman & Robin,3.7,"Action,Sci-Fi",@MegaNerd98 Batman and Robin was still a good movie üòÖ
Batman & Robin,3.7,"Action,Sci-Fi","@hankofjuly it would be undoubtedly the worst batman movie EVER, at least Batman + Robin has color and unique soul put into it. they‚Äôll shit out a bland, gray colored movie"
Batman & Robin,3.7,"Action,Sci-Fi",@ybtoren Yea we wouldn‚Äôt want a good batman and Robin movie
Batman & Robin,3.7,"Action,Sci-Fi","@GtSuperBothBad @OSthatguy Well the quality of the movie itself sucked too but that's a whole other discussion...

My point is, killing off Robin just so you can make Batman into what *you* want him to be shows a fundamental lack of respect for these characters. 

The quality of the films just proves it..."
Batman & Robin,3.7,"Action,Sci-Fi","@thelxternz @hollywoodhandle @ComicBook I don't really care which Robin is introduced to new Batman movie at this point, but I do want to see Batgirl."

Batman & Robin,3.7,"Action,Sci-Fi",@JamesGunn @DCOfficial Who is going to direct it ?. Russo brothers said they are open to direct the batman and Robin movie what are your thoughts?
Batman & Robin,3.7,"Action,Sci-Fi","@TEBerry2 You need to pay attention to the movie. It heavily implies (also SS does it) that Robin‚Äôs murder made Batman snap.
That and the ‚Äú20 years and nothing changed‚Äù. Which is still stupid because Batman endured countless losses in comics and didn‚Äôt turn into a psycho."
Batman & Robin,3.7,"Action,Sci-Fi","@thelxternz @hollywoodhandle @ComicBook Some people are acting like this will simply be another Batman movie, but it won't. They have plans to reintroduce Robin and other members of the Bat family. Hoping that Batgirl definitely makes an appearance in this one."

Batman & Robin,3.7,"Action,Sci-Fi","Since it's almost EG's anniversary, I'm bringing back this old thread to recap why that movie is garbage and the Russos are the worst. They must stay away from DC characters, especially Batman, Nightwing and Robin.

Batman & Robin,3.7,"Action,Sci-Fi","@JsinTooBored I think that the film made it that way so that not only would Batman feel more closer to Robin and Batgirl, but that it makes their teamwork against the villains that more special for this movie.

Batman & Robin,3.7,"Action,Sci-Fi",@tgshepherdvan @CJWritesThings You could also get all the Zorro effect you want from a Juan Cortina movie. Though he was more Robin Hood than Batman.

Batman & Robin,3.7,"Action,Sci-Fi","@GeorgeEftaII A lot of it is nostalgia. I watched Superman 4 a ton when I was a kid and remember it pretty fondly as a result. I haven‚Äôt rewatched it because I know it‚Äôs unlikely to hold up.

Batman & Robin,3.7,"Action,Sci-Fi",@Bart2389 It's an alright movie this and the batman and robin one they are alright I still find them fun to watch though the best ones are 1989 Batman and Batman returns from this era of Batman movies

Avatar: The Way of Water,7.7,"Action,Adventure,Fantasy,Sci-Fi",Avatar 2 defied expectations and broke multiple records. It crushed every Marvel movie released in 2022 by reaching $1 billion in just fourteen days. It crossed $2 billion in thirty-seven days. Avatar 3 has great potential to be another $2+billion hit. The Avatar era has come.
Avatar: The Way of Water,7.7,"Action,Adventure,Fantasy,Sci-Fi","Avatar: The Way of Water is close to the end of its run. Its final total will be $2.315 billion. It is the third highest grossing movie of all time. That is very impressive. For years, haters and naysayers crowed no one cared about Avatar and that its sequel would flop."
